# VANGogh
VANGogh is VR Application, realized for the Virtual Reality course (2021-2022) at the Politecnico of Turin.

This project was created with the aim of giving to the user a tool to know and explore the imaginary world of the artist (Van Gogh).
Initially, he will be in a museum where some of the painter's most famous works are exhibited and then the user will be thrown into his reality.
On this journey, he will have the opportunity to live a unique experience mediated by the interaction of various objects like a van, a backpack, and a camera.
